A computer is a machine that can be programmed to carry out 
sequences of arithmetic or logical operations automatically.
 Modern computers can perform generic sets of operations 
 known as programs. These programs enable computers to 
 perform a wide range of tasks. A computer system is a 
 "complete" computer that includes the hardware, operating 
 system (main software), and peripheral equipment needed 
 and used for "full" operation. This term may also refer to
 a group of computers that are linked and function together,
 such as a computer network or computer cluster.

A broad range of industrial and consumer products use 
computers as control systems. Simple special-purpose devices
 like microwave ovens and remote controls are included, as 
 are factory devices like industrial robots and 
 computer-aided design, as well as general-purpose devices 
 like personal computers and mobile devices like smartphones
 . Computers power the Internet, which links hundreds of millions of other computers and users.
